# backpropagation
This scrips is an streigh forward backpropagation algorithm that solves the XOR gate.

Trying to understand how backpropagation works I wrote a straight forward script to try to understand it before writing a generalized algorithm.

What the script is trying to do is to train an XOR gate. My neural network is very simple:
2 inputs, 2 hidden neurons, and 1 output. (Note that the bias are omitted for simplicity)
